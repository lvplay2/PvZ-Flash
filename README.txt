Plants vs. Zombies (Adobe Flash)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Flash trial version of Plants vs. Zombies created during the development of the PC version by PopCap. Naturally, to protect their legal rights, PopCap added code to the SWF file to prevent local access. Therefore, opening the file directly with a Flash player won't work — unless you remove the relevant restriction code through reverse engineering, which is not exactly legal.

Actually, setting up a simple web environment allows the game to run normally. You’ll need to use Apache for this. Many web developers use it, so I’ll just give a brief explanation without going into too much detail.

Recommended Tool: PHPnow — a lightweight PHP development package that includes Apache, MySQL, and other common components. After installing PHPnow (just follow the prompts), put the PVZ files from the archive into the web root directory (usually htdocs under the PHPnow installation directory).

Then, in your browser, enter:
``` http://127.0.0.1/pvz/ ```
You’ll then be able to see the game interface.

Since the official PHPnow site is no longer online and the installer is not very large, it has already been included in the archive. Feel free to try it if you’re interested.
